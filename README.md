========================================

Coming soon..

>Dr. Evil: You know, I have one simple request. And that is to have sharks with frickin' laser beams attached to their heads! Now evidently my cycloptic colleague informs me that that cannot be done. Ah, would you remind me what I pay you people for, honestly? Throw me a bone here! What do we have?

>Number Two: Node.js

>Dr. Evil: [pause] Right.

>Number Two: It's a mutated software stack.

>Dr. Evil: Is it ill tempered?

>Number Two: Absolutely.

>Dr. Evil: Oh well, that's a start.
